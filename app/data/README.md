# How to Get Data

This project uses the AdventureWorks2022 (OLTP) and AdventureWorksDW2022 (Data Warehouse) databases for testing and development purposes. To set up your environment, youâ€™ll need to restore these databases from the provided backup files.

## Prerequisites

- [AdventureWorks2022.bak]( https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks2022.bak)
- [AdventureWorksDW2022.bak](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorksDW2022.bak)

## Restoring the Databases

1. Place the Backup Files:
    - After downloading, place the .bak files in the app/data folder of this project.
2. Start the SQL Server Container:
    - Build and start your container by running `docker-compose up` in the project root.
3. Restore the Databases:
    - Once the container is running, execute the following SQL script to restore both databases:

```sql
-- Restore AdventureWorks OLTP
RESTORE DATABASE [AdventureWorks2022]
FROM DISK = N'/var/opt/mssql/backup/AdventureWorks2022.bak'
WITH MOVE 'AdventureWorks2022' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/AdventureWorks2022.mdf',
     MOVE 'AdventureWorks2022_log' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/AdventureWorks2022_log.ldf',
     REPLACE;

-- Restore AdventureWorks DW
RESTORE DATABASE [AdventureWorksDW2022]
FROM DISK = N'/var/opt/mssql/backup/AdventureWorksDW2022.bak'
WITH MOVE 'AdventureWorksDW2022' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/AdventureWorksDW2022.mdf',
     MOVE 'AdventureWorksDW2022_log' TO '/var/opt/mssql/data/AdventureWorksDW2022_log.ldf',
     REPLACE;
```
